- When a user goes to your gallery page and they are not logged in:
    - Present the Login / Register links
    - Welcome to the image gallery app
    - Maybe share with them some info about what the app does
    - Hide the upload form stuff
- Register
    - register.php
    - User account created
    - Create their folder
        -   Check to see if a folder exists for username using is_dir()
        -   If a folder does NOT exist, then we need to create one for that user
    - Link to login.php
- Login
    - User logs in with email and password
    - We set session variable with their username and maybe their first name
    - We then redirect them to the main gallery page
